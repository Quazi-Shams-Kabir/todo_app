Checkout: <a href="https://todo-02bg.onrender.com/">TO-DO APP</a>

- this is a practice project of what I've learnt till now in MERN WebDev(25th oct '23)

- functionality is this app are : 
    - adding items in today's list
    - creating new lists
    - items of each lists are separated
    - deleting items
    - deleting lists

- used only a single ejs file to achieve the above mentioned functionalities.

- used headers and footers paritials to practice adding them in index.ejs.

- used mongodb, mongoose, node and express to achieve it

- added css to the ejs file.

- used mongodb atlas to store the db

- all data stored can be seen by anyone unless it has been deleted and anyone can delete anyones data, as it is based on a single atlas db
